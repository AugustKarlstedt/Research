            <h2>How long do we keep your personal information?</h2>
            <p>
                If you want to permanently delete your account or following your explicit request for deletion of any of your personal information, we will delete your account and/or help you to delete your personal information as requested. Due to the nature of the game and the way that users interact, you will need to take all steps necessary to facilitate the deletion, including adopting or removing any geocaches you own and disabling your account. We will then complete the deletion process as soon as possible. The way our systems are structured, in some cases, it may take up to 30 days for records to be
                deleted or overwritten. In some circumstances (set out below) we may keep your
                personal information for longer.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you stop playing or temporarily disable your account, without taking any further steps or asking us to permanently delete your account or personal information, we will keep your information as long as needed to ensure the integrity of the game and the enjoyment of other players. As an example, if you temporarily disable your account without removing or adopting out your geocaches, we will keep your information until it is clear that your geocaches are no longer available to be found. Your geocache and trackable logs and any images associated with them will remain as part of the historic
                record of the geocache or trackable with which they are associated unless you delete them or explicitly request the permanent deletion of your account. If you have provided personal information or content which other users need to use in relation to the Services (for example information about a particular geocache you have logged, or placed; if you have moved or logged a particular trackable; or if you have left instructions or goals about a particular trackable) we may retain that information for as long as we need to
                provide the Services to our other users but we will delete the information or help you to delete the information upon your request. For more information about trackables please click <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=kb.page&id=10">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We know that sometimes users take a break from the game and come back at a later
                time, which is why we donât automatically permanently delete your account and
                personal information if you stop playing or temporarily disable your account. We will contact you if you have stopped playing or temporarily disabled your account to check if you would like us to permanently delete your information. Please note that once your account and personal information has been deleted we cannot get it back. If you donât ask us to permanently delete your account and personal information, we will keep it until you want to reactivate your account and we will store it securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have provided us with personal information for a specific purpose, we will keep your personal information for as long as we need to fulfill that purpose. For example, if you have provided address information as part of a competition entry, we will keep that information for as long as necessary to administer the competition.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will retain your contact details if you have an account with us or if we think you may be interested in marketing messages, offers, promotions, or new Services. You will always have the choice of opting out of receiving these messages. If you do so, we will remove you from our email marketing lists as soon as we can but within 10 business days.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have posted content online in the Geocaching Forums, we will retain that content for as long as we think the topic is relevant. After this time, we may delete the post or archive it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where we have obtained personal information automatically about your use of our apps or website (e.g. analytics), we will keep this information for as long as we feel it may be useful to us to improve and develop our business. We will delete it when it is no longer useful. This will normally be within 24 months of completion of the purpose for which it was originally collected. As an example, we may conduct a test for two months during which one group of users is shown our current home page and one group is shown a new version of our home page to determine which is preferable to users. Twenty-four months after completion of the two-month test, we would delete personal information associated with the test.

            <h2>How do we protect your personal information?</h2>
            <p>
                Groundspeak has implemented many security measures to protect against the loss,
                misuse, and alteration of your information. We protect your account information through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of your information you MUST keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. We also work to protect the security of your credit card information during transmission through the use of third party payment processors using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which
                encrypts the information you input. However, keep in mind that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.

Groundspeak uses this personal data to provide services enabling individuals to participate in location-based play and customer support, information updates and purchases related to such services and in geocaching-related promotions. This data also facilitates our partnersâ participation in geocaching-related marketing and promotions and enables partners to develop other geocaching services.
            </p>

            <h3>Choice</h3>
            <p>Groundspeak will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their data is to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. An individual may opt-out of such uses of their personal data by contacting us at the address given below.</p>

            <p>Groundspeak will not use sensitive personal data for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected, or subsequently authorized by the individual, without first receiving the individualâs affirmative and explicit consent (opt-in). Groundspeak will treat as sensitive any personal data received from a third party where the third party identifies and treats it as sensitive.</p>


            <h3>Accountability for Onward Transfer</h3>
            <p>
                Groundspeak may employ third parties to manage its IT infrastructure, provide credit card processing and customer support, perform analytics, and manage its email service. These entities may have access to personal information if needed to perform their functions for Groundspeak.
            </p>


            <p>Groundspeak may also disclose personal data â such as public profile information and geocache logs â to non-agent third parties by licensing its application program interface (API) to partners who use it to develop other geocaching-related services. If you wish to opt-out of transfers to such non-agent third parties, please contact us at the address given below or change your authorizations in Account Settings to stop such sharing of data.</p>

            <p>Groundspeak may be required to disclose an individualâs personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>

            <p>
                For data received under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, Groundspeak will obtain
                appropriate assurances from its agents that they will safeguard personal data consistent with this Policy. Examples of appropriate assurances that may be provided by agents include the following: a contract obligating the agent to provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the Privacy Shield, its own EU-U.S Privacy Shield certification, or another European Commission adequacy finding.
            </p>
            <p>Groundspeakâs accountability for personal data that it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, Groundspeak remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Groundspeak proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>

            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>Groundspeak will take reasonable and appropriate precautions to protect personal data in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.</p>

            <h3>Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation</h3>
            <p>Groundspeak will use personal data only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Groundspeak will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal data is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete and current.</p>


            <h3>Access</h3>
            <p>Upon request, Groundspeak will grant individuals reasonable access to personal data that it holds about them. Groundspeak will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete personal data that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete. An individual may request access to their data, or otherwise correct, amend, or delete their personal data by contacting us at the address given below or by making changes to their Account Settings.</p>

            <h3>Recourse, Enforcement and Liability</h3>
            <p>
                In compliance with the EU-U.S Privacy Shield, Groundspeak commits to resolve
                complaints about privacy and personal data collection or use. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this Policy should first contact Groundspeak at the address given below. Groundspeak will investigate and attempt to resolve such complaints by reference to the principles contained in this Policy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Groundspeak has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD web site at <a href="www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/" target="_blank">www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/</a> for
                more information and to file a complaint.
            </p>

            <p>Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel.</p>

            <p>Groundspeak is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</p>

            <p>Groundspeak will conduct compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Policy. Any employee that Groundspeak determines is in violation of this policy may be subject to disciplinary action.</p>

            <h2>Contact Information</h2>
            <p>Questions regarding this Policy should be submitted to Groundspeak by e-mail to contact@geocaching.com</p>

            <p>Or by postal mail to:</p>

            <p>Geocaching HQ, 837 N. 34th Street, Suite 300, Seattle, WA 98103 USA</p>

            <h2>Limitations &amp; Charges</h2>
            <p>Groundspeak may also be required to disclose an individualâs personal data in response to a lawful request by public authorities or in connection with a legal obligation. Adherence by Groundspeak to these Privacy Shield Principles may also be limited to the extent necessary to meet national security, public interest or law enforcement obligations, and to the extent expressly permitted by an applicable law, rule or regulation.</p>
