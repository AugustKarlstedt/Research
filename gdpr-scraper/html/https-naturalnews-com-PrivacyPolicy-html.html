<h1>NaturalNews.com Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><b>Effective  Date: 5/25/18</b>
<p>This  Privacy Policy statement is made by the Natural News Network  (&quot;NaturalNews&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;)  and is effective as of 25th May 2018. Here at NaturalNews.com, we are committed to  you and to protecting your privacy rights.   We are committed  to fulfilling our responsibilities under the European Union's General Data  Protection Regulation (&quot;GDPR&quot;) in relation to the collection, retention, use,  and other processing of personal data that is obtained when EU data subjects  visit and interact with the Site. We may use it  to periodically inform you about changes on our Web Site and new products and  services. We do not sell, trade or rent your personal  information to any person or entity not authorized by or associated with us.</p>
<h3>NaturalNews's Privacy  Commitment</h3>
<p>NaturalNews  ask for only the least amount of information necessary, gathering only what we  believe is essential for doing business, or for the specific transaction at  hand. We let customers know the information we have on them and allow them to  opt out of specific engagements. </p>
<p> The goal of  this policy is to make explicit the information we gather on our customers and  users, how we will use it, and how we will not. This policy is unfortunately  longer than we would like, but we must unambiguously address all the relevant  cases. We will try and keep the language simple and direct as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Scope of this Privacy  Policy</h3>
<p>This Privacy  Policy applies to the products and services provided by NaturalNews through  these websites, our mobile applications, and applications posted by NaturalNews  on NaturalNews' websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our  websites, products or services that have a separate privacy policy.</p>
<p>This Privacy  Policy is divided into two parts:</p>
<p>Part I &ndash;  Information NaturalNews.com collects and controls </p>
<p> This part  deals with how NaturalNews collects and uses information about website  visitors, potential customers, users of NaturalNews's products and services,  and others who contact NaturalNews through forms or email addresses published  on or linked to our websites.</p>
<p>Part II &ndash;  General </p>
<p> This part  deals with topics that are relevant to other general topics such as  NaturalNews's security commitments and how we will inform you when we change  this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Part I &ndash; Information NaturalNews collects and  controls</h2>
<h3>What information NaturalNews collects</h3>
<p>We collect  information about you only if we need the information for some legitimate  purpose. NaturalNews will have information about you only if (a) you have  provided the information yourself or (b) NaturalNews has automatically collected  the information. Below we describe the various scenarios that fall under each of those  three categories and the information collected in each one. </p>
<p> <u>Information that you provide us</u> </p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<i>Account signup</i>: When you sign up  for an account to access one or more of our services, we ask for information  such as your name and email address to complete the account signup process. You  may also be required to choose a unique username and a password for accessing  the created account.
</li>
<li>
<i>Summit</i><i> registrations and other form submissions: </i>We  record information that you submit when you (i) register for any event such as  webinars or seminars, (ii) subscribe to our newsletter or any other mailing  list, (iii) submit a form in order to download ebooks, whitepaper, or other  materials, (iv) participate in contests or respond to surveys, or (v) submit a  form to request customer support or to contact NaturalNews for any other  purpose.
</li>
<li>
<i>Payment processing</i>: When you buy  something from us, we ask you to provide your name, contact information, and  credit card information or other payment account information. When you submit  your card information, we store the name and address of the cardholder, the  expiry date and the last four digits of the credit card number. We do not store  the actual credit card number. For quick processing of future payments, if you  have given us your approval, we may store your credit card information or other  payment information in an encrypted format in the secured servers of our  Payment Gateway Service Providers.
</li>
<li>
<i>Testimonials</i>: When you authorize  us to post testimonials about our products and services on websites, we may  include your name and other personal information in the testimonial. You will  be given an opportunity to review and approve the testimonial before we post  it. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us  at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6313110a1502001a230d02171611020f0d0614104d000c0e"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d5a5a7bca3b4b6ac959bb4a1a0a7b4b99bb0a2a6fbb6bab8">[email&#160;protected]</span> </a>
</li>
<li>

IP addresses, etc. are not linked to other personally  identifiable information.
</li>
<li>
<i>Cookies and Other Similar Technologies</i><i></i>: Technologies such as cookies or similar technologies are used by NaturalNews. These technologies are used in analyzing  trends, administering the site, and to gather demographic information about our  user base as a whole.
