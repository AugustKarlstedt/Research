<h1><span class="subpage-header">TGI FRIDAYS<sup>Tm</sup> PRIVACY POLICY</span></h1>

<p class="site-copy-grey">TGI Friday’s Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively “Fridays”) are committed to respecting your privacy. We want to make your online and mobile experiences satisfying and safe. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, store and otherwise process information through this website (“Site”) and our mobile application (“mobile application” or “app”) in the United States. We will not use or share your information except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p class="site-copy-grey">We urge you to read this Privacy Policy so that you understand our commitment to you and your privacy, and how you can participate in that commitment. By using this Site or app, or signing up for Fridays Rewards™ Loyalty Program (“Fridays Rewards”), you acknowledge that you understand and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p class="site-copy-grey">Fridays complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as set forth by the European Parliament in April 2015. The regulation mandates that Fridays protects the personal data and privacy of EU data subjects. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the GDPR, the GDPR principles shall govern with respect to EU residents.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><span class="subpage-header">CONSENT</span></h1>

<p class="site-copy-grey">Fridays collects information about you in connection with many of our services. When working with us or using our Site or app, you may be prompted to make an account which may hold Personal Information, such as your name, birthdate, mailing address, email address, or credit card information. Prior to collecting information, Fridays will obtain your consent. At any point in time, you can revoke consent and we will cease using and processing your data immediately.</p>

<p class="site-copy-grey">Fridays gives you choices about the ways we collect, use, and share your personal information. You can choose what contact and financial information will be stored in your account and preferences. However, if you choose not to provide certain details, some of your experiences with us may be affected.</p>

<p class="site-copy-grey">In some jurisdictions, in addition to you agreeing to this Privacy Policy, data privacy laws may require us to obtain a separate consent before we send you information that you have not specifically requested. In certain circumstances, your consent may be implied (e.g. where communications are required in order to fulfill your requests and/or where you have volunteered information for use by us). In other cases, we may seek your consent expressly in accordance with applicable laws (e.g. where the information collected is regarded to be Sensitive Personal Information under local regulations).</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><span class="subpage-header">ACCESS TO UPDATE/DELETE PERSONAL INFORMATION</span></h1>

<p
    class="site-copy-grey">You have the right to access and limit the use and disclosure of your personal data. Fridays provides you many opportunities to access and update your Personal Information. You can ensure that any account, contact, or financial information is up-to-date and you can correct, update, or delete inaccuracies to the information by logging into your account or contacting Fridays at <a href="https://www.tgifridays.com/contact/">Contact Us</a>. Fridays will attempt to answer all requests that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete it, provided Fridays is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes.</p>

<p class="site-copy-grey">In addition, to protect your privacy, we will require you to prove your identity before granting access to, or agreeing to update, correct or delete your Personal Information and we will only implement requests with respect to Personal Information about you (not anyone else).</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><span class="subpage-header">A NOTE SPECIFIC TO EU DATA SUBJECTS</span></h1>

When you provide personal information to Fridays, you consent to the processing of your information in the United States. Our websites are hosted in the United States. If, at any point in time, you wish to know what data we process about you, you can request to access the information by completing the <a href="https://www.tgifridays.com/gdpr/">GDPR Contact Us online form</a>.</p>

If Fridays receives a request, we will inform all third parties who have the data of this request. You also have the right to object to your personal data being processed for profiling, direct marketing, scientific research, and statistics.

<ol
      style="padding: 15.0px 0.0px 15.0px 15.0px;font-size: 1.5em;">
<li><h3><b>Personal Information</b></h3></li>
<p><span
      class="site-copy-grey">We only collect Personal Information from you when you voluntarily submit such information on our Site or when using our app. We use this information for the specific purpose for which it was provided, such as registering for Fridays Rewards, entering a contest, participating in a survey, finding a Fridays™ location, making a reservation, ordering online (where applicable) and other purposes described in this Privacy Policy. “Personal Information” refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, such as an identification number, physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural, or social identifiers. Personal Information collected may include the following: name, address, date of birth, gender, and contact data (i.e., email address, telephone number, and physical address).</span></p>
<p> </p>
<li><h3><b>Non-personal Information</b></h3></li>
<p><span
      class="site-copy-grey">We may also collect information that is related to you but that does not personally identify you (“Non-personal Information”). Non-personal Information includes information that could personally identify you in its original form, but that we have modified (for instance, by aggregating, anonymizing, or de-identifying such information) in order to remove or hide any Personal Information. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<li><h3><b>Technical Information</b></h3></li>
<p><span
      class="site-copy-grey">We may also collect Technical Information about visitors to our Site and users of our app, such as the domain type, browser version, service provider, and device type (for mobile) used to access our Site or app. “Technical Information” is information that does not, by itself, identify a specific individual but which could be used to indirectly identify you. Like many other commercial websites, our Site may employ a standard technology called a “cookie” to collect information about how our Site is used and to remember visitors. This information also provides us information about the technical stability of our Site, app and Fridays Rewards™ program, as well as support our customer analytics efforts. When you visit our Site, our Servers send a cookie to your computer or mobile device to help personalize your experience and advertisements. Cookies recognize your web browser but information collected from cookies is not personally identifiable. Some web browsers provide settings that allow you to control or reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer, tablet or mobile device. Although you are not required to accept cookies, if you block or reject them, certain features of our Site will be disabled and you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our Site. 
</span></p>
<p><span
      class="site-copy-grey">For those guests that access our in-store Wi-Fi, we will have access to such guests’ device ID and name, if available.</span></p>
<p><span
      class="site-copy-grey">
When you log in to our mobile application, you will be asked whether you want the mobile application to remember you. If you choose yes, the mobile application will remain logged in to your information. At any time you can choose to log out by choosing the logout button on the application.

<li><h3><b>Information Collected about Friends/Family</b></h3></li>
<p><span
      class="site-copy-grey">Fridays may also collect information about your friends and family through your interactions on our services. Referring friends to our services requires you to send their personal information to Fridays. Other instances, such as sharing content, may also require you to send their personal information to us.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<li><h3><b>Information Collected from Social Media Applications/Networking Websites</b></h3></li>
<p><span
        class="site-copy-grey">Our Site includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and other widgets that run on our Site. These features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the organization providing it. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<li><h3><b>Information Collected from Other Sources</b></h3>
<p><span
      class="site-copy-grey">Fridays may also collect information about you from other sources to help us correct or supplement our records, improve the quality or personalization of our service to you, and prevent or detect fraud. We work closely with third parties (for example, business partners, service providers, subcontractors, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, fraud protection services) and may receive information about you from them. The following are some examples:</span></p>
<ul

<li
        style="padding: 10.0px 0.0px 0.0px 5.0px;list-style-type: disc;"><b>Log Files: </b> Log files record website activity on our services and enable us to gather statistics about our users' browsing habits.

<li
      style="padding: 10.0px 0.0px 0.0px 5.0px;list-style-type: disc;"><b>Clear GIFs: </b> Clear GIFs, sometimes called &quot;web bugs&quot; or &quot;web beacons,&quot; are small electronic images that are placed on a web page or in an email message. We use clear GIFs to monitor user behavior, deliver cookies, collect information, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness, and to tell if a recipient has opened and acted upon an email.</li>
</ul>

<p><span
      class="site-copy-grey">Guests that join Fridays Rewards will be asked to provide their email address and phone number.

<h1><span class="subpage-header">SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</span></h1>

<p class="site-copy-grey">Security of all information is of the utmost importance for Fridays. Fridays uses technical and physical safeguards to protect the security of your personal information from unauthorized disclosure. We operate secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems to keep all information secure. We also make all attempts to ensure that only necessary people and third parties have access to personal information. Any particularly sensitive information, such as a customer’s credit card number, is encrypted prior to transmission. Nevertheless, such security measures cannot prevent all loss, misuse, or alteration of personal information and we are not responsible for any damages or liabilities relating to any such incidents to the fullest extent permitted by law. In the case of a data breach, we will notify you without delay of any loss, misuse or alteration of personal information that may affect you. We will notify relevant regulatory bodies within 72 hours of a breach.</p>

<p class="site-copy-grey">Fridays retains your information for business purposes, for as long as your account is active, and/or for as long as is reasonably necessary to provide you with our products and services. Fridays will also retain your information as reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We may also retain cached or archived copies of your information for a reasonable period of time. At any point in time, you can withdraw consent and we will immediately stop processing your data.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><span class="subpage-header">INFORMATION WE DISTRIBUTE OR MAKE ACCESSIBLE TO THIRD PARTIES</span></h1>

<p class="site-copy-grey">We will not provide access to your information other than as described in this Privacy Policy. We will not rent, sell or share information about you other than as described in this Privacy Policy.
The information that you provide is collected by Fridays. In the case of links to our gift card site or other sites, the information you voluntarily provide at those sites will only be shared with those service vendors who help Fridays administer those websites or mobile application and the services they provide.
