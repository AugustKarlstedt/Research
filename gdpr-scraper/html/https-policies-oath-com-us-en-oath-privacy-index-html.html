This policy applies to Oath <a href="https://www.oath.com/our-brands/">brands</a>, websites, apps, advertising services, products, services or technologies (we’ll collectively refer to these as “Services”). &nbsp;Additional privacy practices for certain Services can be found in <a href="#1"> Details for Specific Products and Services</a>.</p>
