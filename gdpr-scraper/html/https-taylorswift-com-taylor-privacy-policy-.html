<br><br><b>
WHEN DOES THIS POLICY APPLY?
</b><br><br>
This Policy is only applicable to the Services and not to any other website or service that you may be able to access from any of the Services or use in connection with the Services. When you click on an advertisement or a logo displayed on any of the Services that links you to a different website (including, without limitation, Facebook, Instagram, iTunes, tumblr, Twitter and YouTube), or when you use any third-party app, tool, widget, plug-in or extension on the Services or as part of any of the Services, information about you may be collected through automated means.

2. Information We Automatically Collect
</b><br><br>
When you access the Services, we collect and analyze information such as your IP address, browser types, browser language, operating system, the state or country from which you accessed the Services, software and hardware attributes (including device IDs) referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, files you download, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the terms you use in searches on our sites, the date and time you used the Services and/or upload or post content, error logs, and other similar information. As discussed further below, we and our service providers (which are third-party companies that work on our behalf), may use a variety of technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information.
<br><br><b>
HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?</b><br><br>
We, or our service providers, use your information for various purposes depending on the types of information we have collected from and about you, in order to:<br><ul>
<li>fulfill your service request or product order; </li>

</ul>
We may combine these types of information together. We may also aggregate and/or anonymize any information collected through the Services so that such information can no longer be linked to you or your device. We may use such information for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also share such data with any third parties, including advertisers, promotional partners, and sponsors.<br><br><b>
WHAT ARE OUR LEGAL BASES FOR USING YOUR INFORMATION?</b><br><br>
The laws in some jurisdictions require us to tell you about the legal ground we rely upon in order to use or disclose your information.&nbsp; Where those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows: <br>
<ul>
<li><b>To perform our obligations under a contract with you.</b> For example, to comply with the terms of service of our websites, which you accept by browsing the Services, or when you register for an account at our store.</li><br>
<li><b>Consent.</b> Where required by law and in some other cases, we collect and use your information on the basis of your implied or express consent. </li><br>
<li><b>To further our or our partners’ legitimate interests.</b> For example, to provide security for the Services, operate our business and the Services, comply with legal requirements, and prevent fraud.</li></ul><br><b>
DO YOU USE COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES?</b><br><br>
To collect the information in the “Information We Automatically Collect” section above, we and our service providers use Internet server logs, cookies, tracking pixels, and other similar tracking technologies. We use these technologies in order to offer you a more tailored experience in the future, by understanding and remembering your particular browsing preferences. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a site, that enable us to: (i) recognize your computer; (ii) store your preferences and settings; (iii) understand the web pages of the Services you have visited; (iv) enhance your user experience by delivering and measuring the effectiveness of content and advertising tailored to your interests; (v) perform searches and analytics; and (vi) assist with security and administrative functions. Some cookies are placed in your browser cache while those associated with Flash technologies are stored with your Adobe Flash Player files.
<br><br>
As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather information through other methods. Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information (e.g.,&nbsp;Internet Explorer;&nbsp;Google Chrome;&nbsp;Mozilla Firefox; or&nbsp;Apple Safari). You can also manage the use of Flash technologies, including flash cookies and local storage objects with the Flash management tools available at&nbsp;Adobe's website. You can also visit your mobile device manufacturer's website (or the website for its operating system) for instructions on any additional privacy controls in your mobile operating system, such as privacy settings for device identifiers and geolocation. Please note that by blocking, disabling, or managing any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.<br><br><b>
DO YOU USE ONLINE ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING TECHNOLOGIES?</b><br><br><b>
1. Analytics</b><br><br>
We may use third-party web analytics services (such as those of Google Analytics) on our Services to collect and analyze usage information through cookies and similar tools; engage in auditing, research, or reporting; assist with fraud prevention; and provide certain features to you. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.
<br><br>
If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools (such as clear GIFs) to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.<br><br><b>
2. Online Advertising </b><br><br>
The Services may integrate third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Services, as well as on other websites you visit and other applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.
<br><br>
Third parties may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about you as discussed above. These third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) may also serve tailored ads to you as you use the Internet and Internet-connected applications, and access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services to assist in this activity.
<br><br>
We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on the device you use to access the Services by such non-affiliated third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the&nbsp;<a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/" target="_blank">Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a>, or if you live in the European Union, <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank">Your Online Choices</a>,&nbsp;to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Ads for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated" target="_blank">Google Ads Settings page</a>. We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
<br><br>
Please note that if you exercise the choices above, you will still see advertising when you use the Services, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.<br><br><b>
3. Notice Concerning Do Not Track</b><br><br>
You may be able to adjust your browser’s settings to turn on a “do not track” feature. Although our policy may change in the future, because there is no uniform standard for “do not track” signal recognition currently, we do not support “do not track” and will not honor your web browser’s “do not track” signal.<br><br>
We do not intentionally or knowingly allow other parties to collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites, when you visit the websites or use any of the Services.
<br><br><b>
WHEN DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH OTHER PARTIES?
</b><br><br>
We may use your information to provide analyses of the users of the Services, in the aggregate, to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties. We may also share your non-personally-identifiable information with our business partners for the purpose of their delivering content, including ads, on the Services and on third-party websites.
<br><br>
We may disclose your information to our employees, agents, contractors and sub-contractors, and to our related and affiliated entities, including, but not limited to, 13 Management, LLC, Firefly Entertainment, Inc., Swift Merchandising, Inc., TAS Rights Management, LLC, Taylor Swift Productions, Inc., and their respective employees, agents, contractors and sub-contractors, for the limited purpose of enabling them to communicate with you directly about events and promotions that may be of interest to you.
<br><br>
We will share your information with other parties under the following circumstances:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Protection of Rights.</b> We will share your information if we have a good faith belief that: (i) access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, such as a court order or subpoena, or a request by law enforcement or governmental authorities; (ii) such action is appropriate to enforce the <a href="https://taylorswift.com/taylor-terms-conditions/">Terms of Use</a> for the Services, including any investigation of potential violations thereof; (iii) such action is necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues associated with the Services; and/or (iv) such action is appropriate to protect our rights, property or safety or the rights, property or safety of our employees, users of the Services, or others.</li><br>
<li><b>Asset Transfers.</b> If we become involved in a merger, acquisition, or other transaction involving the sale of some or all of our assets, in contemplation of such a transaction, or in the event of an insolvency or bankruptcy, the information collected from you through your use of the Services may be included in the transferred assets. Should such an event occur, we will use reasonable measures to notify you, either through e-mail and/or a prominent notice on the Services.
</li><br>
<li><b>Service Providers.</b> We may share your information with the service providers that we engage in connection with the Services, including those who help administer our e-mail communications, operate the on-line store and U.S. shopping cart at (http://store.taylorswift.com); operate the international shopping cart; data storage, conduct website administration, and maintain and administer the network for the Services. These companies may access your information to the extent required in order to perform services on our behalf.
</li><br>
<li><b>Sweepstakes and Contests.</b> If you choose to participate in any on-line promotions such as a sweepstakes or a contest on the Services, your information collected in connection with such promotion may be shared with the third-party sponsor of the promotion, or as otherwise provided in the Official Rules. You should carefully review the Official Rules of each promotion in which you choose to participate through the Services, as the Official Rules may contain additional important information about a third party’s collection and use of your information. To the extent that the Official Rules of any promotion conflict with this Policy, the Official Rules will govern collection and use of your information in conjunction with that particular promotion.</li></ul>
We will not share your information with third parties for the purposes of their direct marketing unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure.
<br><br><b>

CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
