                     <p>When you visit the <em>Science</em> Website there are two types of information you might provide to us: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose
                        and website use information collected by us as you interact with our website.
                        
                     </p>
                     <p>In some areas of the <em>Science</em> Website, we request or may request that you provide personal information, including your name, address, e-mail address, telephone
                        number, credit card number, contact information, billing information, and any other information from which your identity is
                        discernible. In other areas, we collect or may collect demographic information such as your age, career focus and discipline,
                        preferences, gender, educational degrees, ethnic background, interests, and household income range. Sometimes we collect or
                        may collect a combination of the two types of information. Examples of areas on the <em>Science</em> Website where we collect or may collect personal or combined personal and demographic data are pages where you can sign up
                        to use a service, post a resume, enter a contest, or purchase a product.
                        
                     </p>
                     <p>We also gather or may gather certain information about your use of our site, such as what areas you visit and what services
                        you access. Moreover, there is information about your computer hardware and software that we collect or may collect. This
                        information can include, without limitation, your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, and referring website
                        addresses.

                        be collected and used by others over whom we have no control. We are not responsible for the use made by third parties of
                        information you post or otherwise make available in public areas of the <em>Science</em> Website. We retain indefinitely all the information we gather about you in an effort to make your repeat use of our website
                        more efficient, practical, and relevant.

                     <p>On <em>Science</em> Careers, we give you the option of putting your resume or CV (collectively referred to as "resume") in our database. There
                        are two ways of doing this:
                        
                     </p>
                     <p>You can post your resume in our database as either a public or private
                        resume. Public resumes can be searched by parties with access to our
                        searchable resume database. 
                        
                     </p>
                     <p>If you allow your resume to be searchable, then all parties with access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof)
                        will have access to your resume. We attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof) only to
                        paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals as well as law enforcement and
                        national security agencies, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. We are not responsible
                        for the use made of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database. You may remove
                        your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, employers, recruiters, and others who have paid for access
                        to that database or to obtain a copy of that database as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to the database
                        may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or
                        privacy of resumes in these instances.
                        
                     </p>
                     <p>Please Note: It is not our practice to restrict access to our resume database to any particular customer(s). Please be advised
                        that your current employer or an entity affiliated with your current employer might be a customer of the <em>Science</em>Careers.org sites. We are not responsible for any actions or results that may occur as a result of any customer's access to
                        and/or use of your resume.
                        
                     </p>
                     <p>We reserve the right to remove from our database any resumes we consider to be illegal or offensive.</p><a href="#ContentTop" title="Go to the top of the page">Back to Top</a><a id="additional" name="additional"></a><h3>ADDITIONAL TERMS AND RULES FOR SOCIAL NETWORKING</h3>

                     <p>We use "cookies" to help personalize and maximize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard
                        drive by a web page server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely
                        assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary
                        purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server
                        that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize pages or register for services on any of the <em>Science</em> websites, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password, and preferences). Because of
                        our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience. When you return
                        to the <em>Science</em> Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized.
                        We also use cookies to track click streams and for load balancing.

                     <p>You may have the ability to accept or decline all cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually
                        modify your browser setting to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser setting
                        to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. It is possible
                        to sign in to any of the <em>Science</em> websites without accepting cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively
                        impact your experience at the <em>Science</em> Website.

                        purposes. When you place an order online at any of the <em>Science</em> websites, your credit card information is protected through the use of encryption utilizing Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol,

                        When you've finished your transactions and begin the checkout process, you will move into the secure area of our site. A warning

                        from http to https, to let you know you are in a secure area. Also, a key or closed lock will appear in the lower left-hand
                        corner of your screen to notify you of this change. You will remain in this secure zone for the entire checkout process. In
                        addition, only the last four digits of your credit card number will be revealed on the screen when confirming an order. Of
                        course, we securely transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card service company during order processing.
