	<p><strong>Commitment to Privacy and Security</strong><br>
		Paymentech, LLC  (&quot;Chase&quot;) is committed to safeguarding the privacy and  security of the information we collect. This Privacy Statement explains the  policies we follow with respect to the handling of customer information  collected by Chase. This Privacy Statement covers the services  provided by Chase to our merchant customers, including merchant  customers using the Chase Mobile Checkout application.</p>
	<p><strong>Information We Collect</strong><br>
		Chase's customers, the customers of its affiliates, and the customers of other third-parties for which Chase may provide outsourced or subcontracted processing services, ("Merchants") are businesses and other legal entities desiring to accept credit or debit cards or other payment methods, as payment for goods or services. Chase does not have direct relationships with, or collect information directly from, individual consumers other than in their capacity as owners or operators of a commercial enterprise. Chase does not provide services for consumer, personal, family or household purposes. The information we receive and collect is strictly related to our business customers and the payment transactions that we assist them in executing, as well as from prospective or potential business customers or website visitors who may be interested in learning more about our services ("Customer Data"). The transaction information we receive from our Merchants may include personal financial information about their customers or applicants (e.g., name, address, credit or debit card account numbers and expiration dates, etc.) who may be individual consumers and other cardholders ("Cardholder Data"). Chase understands that such information is sensitive and takes appropriate steps to protect the confidentiality and security of all information collected by Chase in accordance with this Privacy Statement.</p>
	<p><strong>Customer Data and Cardholder Data</strong><br>
		Use and disclosure of Customer Data collected by Chase varies  based on the information source and type, as set forth below:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Browsing the Website.</strong> When you browse Chase's website, we may collect information  regarding the domain and host from which you access the Internet, the Internet  Protocol address of the computer or Internet Service Provider you are using,  and anonymous site statistical data. In addition, we may collect information  that you voluntarily provide us via online forms and questionnaires, including  information you may provide about your business in order to apply to become a  Merchant, or thereafter if you use any of our online Merchant services. Chase's website is intended for commercial use only, and we collect,  retain and use information about visitors to our websites only for specific business  purposes, including: (i) to respond to requests for information about our  products and services (see &quot;Your Inquiries&quot; below), (ii) to  administer the website or improve site performance, (iii) to provide customer  support (e.g., to allow a prospective Merchant to complete an online account  application, to allow a Merchant to view and manage records, accounts and  funds, or to help enhance our products and services); (iv) for security  purposes and to combat fraud (e.g., to protect against unauthorized access to  Chase systems, or Merchant accounts and information), (v) to  generate broad statistical and demographic information, and (vi) to comply with  certain laws, regulations, and card association rules and regulations. In  addition, when you link to Chase's website from the website of any  third-party advertiser, we may receive information about you from such  third-party, including your contact information and information stored in  &quot;cookies&quot; on such third-party's website. Please check the privacy  policy of these websites concerning what information may be collected by the  third-party and shared with Chase. Such information is used by us  only for the purposes set forth above with respect to information collected  directly from you at our own website.</li>
		<li><strong>Your Inquiries.</strong> When you complete and submit a form on our website, send us an e-mail,  send us a fax, or contact us by telephone to solicit information about our  services or the company in general, Chase may store the inquiries  and their contents. Information you submit via an inquiry is collected only  with your knowledge and active participation, and may be used by Chase  to respond to your inquiries, to contact you, to inform you of  services of Chase or its partners that may be of use to you, and for  similar business purposes. Information collected during the course of an  inquiry will not be sold or otherwise disclosed to any third party; provided  that such information may be shared internally with our affiliated entities for  the business purposes set forth above. </li>
		<li><strong>Opening an Account or Using Chase Services.</strong> When you submit an application to obtain a Merchant account and become a Merchant, you will be required to provide us with certain information about your business, and its owners and officers, which may also act as guarantors of the Merchant's obligations. Chase may also obtain and store information about the Merchant, and its officers, owners and guarantors, from consumer reporting agencies, credit bureaus, relevant financial institutions, and other entities. Chase may use, retain and disclose this information to (i) comply with any applicable federal legislation requiring Chase to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each entity with which it establishes a Merchant relationship, and (ii) evaluate your eligibility for a Merchant account, which may involve disclosure to consumer reporting agencies, commercial credit bureaus, and relevant financial institutions. Chase may also use your information to contact you about other Chase offerings and services. If you are, or become a Merchant, Chase may disclose your information during the course of providing such services to card associations, banks and other financial institutions that are involved in the course of processing or screening the transaction, and to third parties that have contracted with Chase to perform certain functions of our services on our behalf. In addition, Chase may use, or disclose your information to third parties for the additional purposes of facilitating and completing merchant-initiated or authorized transactions, complying with federal, state and local laws, including credit reporting laws and card association rules, assisting in preventing fraud, or informing you about general company news, product updates and developments, card association rules, and industry trends, offering you products and services that may be of interest to you, or as otherwise may be permitted or required by applicable law. </li>
		<li><strong>Customers of Our Merchants.</strong> A customer who purchases a product or service from a Merchant using a credit or debit card, or any other method of payment for which we provide the Merchant with transaction processing services, is required to provide that Merchant with certain Cardholder Data in order to make the purchase, including the customer's name and credit card number. Our Merchants may transmit certain parts of this information to Chase for the purpose of processing the transaction. During the course of providing processing services to our Merchants, we may disclose such Cardholder Data to banks, processors, credit and debit card organizations and associations, and other financial institutions that are involved in the course of effecting the transaction represented by the Cardholder Data. In addition, we may disclose some or all of the information we collect, to our affiliated companies or to non-affiliated third parties (subject to contractual confidentiality provisions to protect such information) such as a vendor or service company that we hire to prepare our Merchants' account statements or to provide support or services for one or more of our products. We will not disclose Cardholder Data to any third party, except to facilitate and complete transactions submitted to us by Merchants, or otherwise in the course of providing services to our Merchants, or to comply with federal, state and local laws or the rules and regulations of the respective card organizations or other payment entities (e.g. Visa, MasterCard, American Express, NACHA, etc.). </li>
	</ol>
	<p>In addition, Chase may share certain Customer Data (but not Cardholder Data) with its affiliated entities for marketing purposes and other business purposes.</p>
	<p><strong>Protection of Cardholder Data and Customer Data</strong><br>
		Chase has implemented various measures, including appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards, designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of Cardholder Data and Customer Data, protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information. Such measures may include, among others, encryption, physical access security and other appropriate technologies. Chase continually reviews and enhances its security systems, as necessary. Chase is subject to the detailed rules and regulations of the various credit and debit card organizations and networks (i.e. VISA, MasterCard, American Express, NYCE, Star, etc.), relating to the security and safeguarding of Cardholder Data, including, but not limited to, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards ("PCI"), VISA Inc.'s Cardholder Information Security Program ("CISP") and MasterCard International's Site Data Protection Program ("SDP"). Chase endeavors to comply with all such rules at all times. Pursuant to such rules and regulations, Chase is required to undergo periodic third-party assessments and periodic network scans to ensure that, among other things, Chase has installed and maintains a firewall configuration to protect data; does not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters; protects stored data; encrypts transmission of Cardholder Data and sensitive information across public networks; uses and regularly updates anti-virus software; develops and maintains secure systems and applications; restricts access to data to those with a business need-to-know; tracks and monitors all access to network resources and Cardholder Data; regularly tests security systems and processes; assigns a unique ID to each person with computer access; restricts physical access to Cardholder Data; and maintains a policy that addresses information security. Additional information regarding the requirements of VISA's CISP and Mastercard's Site Data Protection program (SDP) can be found on the VISA, Inc. and MasterCard International Web sites.</p>
